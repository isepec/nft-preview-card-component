## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Responsive design
- Flexbox

### What I learned

- As of writing this text, most browsers do not support using `::before` or `::after` on `<img>` tags.
- An `<img>` can't have a `position: relative` for an element with `position: absolute`, so we have to use a container.
